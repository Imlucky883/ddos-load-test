## The February 2020 attack reported by CyperPunk2077
One more recent example of a DDoS attack occurred in December 2020, when the online services of the popular video game "Cyberpunk 2077" were targeted by attackers. The game's developer, CD Projekt Red, confirmed that their servers were hit with a DDoS attack that caused disruption to their online services for several hours.

The attack came at a time when Cyberpunk 2077 was already facing a lot of criticism due to the poor performance of the game on older consoles. The DDoS attack added to the company's troubles, causing frustration for players and potential loss of revenue for CD Projekt Red. 

## The February 2018 GitHub DDoS attack
One of the largest verifiable DDoS attacks on record targeted GitHub, a popular online code management service used by millions of developers. This attack reached 1.3 Tbps, sending packets at a rate of 126.9 million per second.

The GitHub attack was a memcached DDoS attack, so there were no botnets involved. Instead the attackers leveraged the amplification effect of a popular database caching system known as memcached. By flooding memcached servers with spoofed requests, the attackers were able to amplify their attack by a magnitude of about 50,000x.

Luckily, GitHub was using a DDoS protection service, which was automatically alerted within 10 minutes of the start of the attack. This alert triggered the process of mitigation and GitHub was able to stop the attack quickly. The massive DDoS attack only ended up lasting about 20 minutes.

## The 2016 Dyn attack
Another massive DDoS attack was directed at Dyn, a major DNS provider, in October of 2016. This attack was devastating and created disruption for many major sites, including Airbnb, Netflix, PayPal, Visa, Amazon, The New York Times, Reddit, and GitHub. This was done using malware called Mirai. Mirai creates a botnet out of compromised Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as cameras, smart TVs, radios, printers, and even baby monitors. To create the attack traffic, these compromised devices are all programmed to send requests to a single victim.

Fortunately Dyn was able to resolve the attack within one day, but the motive for the attack was never discovered. Hacktivist groups claimed responsibility for the attack as a response to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange being denied Internet access in Ecuador, but there was no proof to back up this claim. There are also suspicions that the attack was carried out by a disgruntled gamer.

## The 2015 GitHub attack
The largest DDoS attack ever at the time, this one also happened to target GitHub. This politically motivated attack lasted several days and adapted itself around implemented DDoS mitigation strategies. The DDoS traffic originated in China and specifically targeted the URLs of two GitHub projects aimed at circumventing Chinese state censorship. It is speculated that the intent of the attack was to try and pressure GitHub into eliminating those projects.

The attack traffic was created by injecting JavaScript code into the browsers of everyone who visited Baidu, China’s most popular search engine. Other sites who were using Baidu’s analytics services were also injecting the malicious code; this code was causing the infected browsers to send HTTP requests to the targeted GitHub pages. In the aftermath of the attack it was determined that the malicious code was not originating from Baidu, but rather being added by an intermediary service.
